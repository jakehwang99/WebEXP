# WebEXP
This is a project for me, Jake Hwang, to teach myself how to code in HTML5 and CSS as well as build my portfolio in the form 
of a website so that it is easily accessible to other that are curious about me and want to know about what I like to do.

This could also be a way for interviewers to get to know my background quickly and easily.

I am using apple.com as a reference of what a good website looks like (NOTE: not using it as a reference on how my final portfolio will look like on release)
